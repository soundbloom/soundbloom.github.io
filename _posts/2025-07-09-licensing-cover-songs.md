When you upload a cover song through our distribution service, you'll need to hold a proper mechanical license before your release can go live on streaming platforms. This isn't just a recommendation, it's a legal requirement that protects both you and the original copyright holders.

## Understanding Mechanical Licensing

A mechanical license grants you the right to reproduce and distribute your recorded version of someone else's song. Whether you're releasing a stripped-down acoustic version of a pop hit or a full band arrangement of a classic track, you need permission from the copyright holders before your cover can legally reach listeners.

This requirement applies to all cover songs, regardless of:
- How you plan to distribute (streaming, digital downloads, physical copies)
- Whether you're giving away your recording for free
- How different your arrangement sounds from the original

## Why Distribution Platforms Require Licensing

Digital streaming platforms and music stores have strict policies about copyrighted content. Without proper licensing documentation, your release will be rejected during the review process. This can delay your release date and create complications with your planned marketing campaigns.

More importantly, distributing unlicensed cover songs can result in:
- Copyright infringement claims
- Revenue losses from takedown notices
- Potential legal action from publishers
- Account suspension from streaming platforms

## Simplifying the Licensing Process

Contacting publishers and navigating copyright law can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with multiple songs or hard-to-reach copyright holders. This is where specialized licensing services become invaluable.

We partner with **[Easy Song](https://www.easysong.com/?PartnerID=392)**, who handles the entire mechanical licensing process for artists and labels. Their team works under the Compulsory Mechanical Licensing Law, which means they can secure licenses for virtually any song, even when publishers might otherwise refuse direct requests.

### How It Works

The process is straightforward:

1. **Submit your songs** - Provide track titles, original artists, and your contact information
2. **Choose your format** - Specify whether you need licensing for streaming, digital downloads, or physical copies
3. **Payment and processing** - Pay the licensing fee and royalties upfront
4. **Receive documentation** - Get your PDF Proof of Licensing within 1-2 business days

### Pricing Structure

Easy Song charges **$16.99 per format per song**, plus statutory royalties that go directly to the copyright holders. For example:
- Single cover song for streaming: $16.99 + royalties
- Same song for both streaming and digital download: $33.98 + royalties (two formats)
- Volume discounts available for multiple songs

### What You Receive

Your licensing package includes:
- **PDF Proof of Licensing** delivered via email
- **Secure online storage** of your licensing documents
- **Liner note requirements** for proper crediting
- **Lifetime access** to reorder at half-price for exact duplicates

## Legal Protection Under Compulsory Law

The Compulsory Mechanical Licensing Law was designed to foster creativity while protecting original creators. Under this law, copyright holders cannot refuse a mechanical license request, though they retain the right to collect royalties from your recording.

This legal framework allows independent artists to cover popular songs that might otherwise be inaccessible through direct publisher negotiations. Easy Song's expertise in this area means they can secure licenses even for highly protected catalog tracks.

## Best Practices for Cover Song Distribution

Before submitting your cover songs for licensing:

- **Double-check song information** - Verify original artist names, composers, and publishers
- **Plan your formats** - Decide whether you need streaming-only or multiple format licensing
- **Allow processing time** - Submit licensing requests at least one week before your planned release date
- **Keep documentation** - Save your licensing proofs for future reference and potential audits

## Getting Started

If you're planning to distribute cover songs through our platform, you'll need to obtain mechanical licenses before uploading your tracks. Without proper licensing documentation, your release will be rejected during our review process.
