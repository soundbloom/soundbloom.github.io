> These guidelines are not comprehensive and each platform has their own guidelines. If content delivered does not meet a specific platform's guidelines, it may be rejected.

> ## Cover Images
- Must be a square image.  
- Cannot be stretched, upscaled, or appear to be low-resolution.  
- Recommended size: **3000x3000**. Minimum size: **1400x1400**.  
- Information must match the album title and artist name.  
- No website addresses, social media links, or contact information.  
- No sexually explicit imagery.  
- Cannot be misleading by featuring a different artist’s name more prominently.  
- No third-party logos or trademarks without express written permission from the trademark holder.  
- Must be copyright-free (no images taken off the first page of Google).

## Song Audios
- Must contain **no copyrighted samples**, vocals, loops, etc.  
- Must be **high quality audio**. A minimum of 16 bits and 44.1kHz is required.
- Audio must be **stereo**.  
- Audio must be **at least 60 seconds** long.  
- **Content must not be AI-generated.**  
- **Non-music content**, such as podcasts, **is not supported**.

## Code Allocation

- ISRCs must be transferred if a song/release has already been distributed anywhere. Do not create new codes.  
- ISRCs must be linked to the actual song to distribute. Do not include other song’s ISRCs for algorithm boosting.  
- ISRCs must be real and follow the international standard format. Do not put `YOURCOMPANY250001`, for example.  

---

## Licensing

- In order to use content you didn’t directly create, you must have proper licensing.  
- For leased beats and created beats, we require a lease agreement or some other form of documentation.  
- For free and public samples, we require the source where you obtained it. We can often clear the rights with the website directly.  
- For remixes, you must have a remix license provided by the original rightsholder.  
- For covers, you must have a mechanical license.  
- All documentation must be verifiable with trusted agencies — i.e., don’t give a PDF that only says "song approved."

## Content ID Guidelines

- There are separate guidelines for content delivered to YouTube Content ID, Facebook, Mixcloud, TikTok, and the SoundBloom Content Match.  
- All content must be fully owned by you (the Artist), or you must hold all necessary rights and permissions to distribute it (as a Label). Content that is public, leased, purchased, or otherwise not exclusively owned is not eligible for delivery to Content ID platforms.

### Disallowed Content List:

- Audio with watermarks  
- Remixes and covers  
- Creative Commons / Public Domain  
- Audio with samples  
- Nature sounds  
- Sound effects  
- Audiobooks  
- Drum loops  
- Soundscapes  
- Podcasts  
- Spoken word  

- Only legitimate videos can be claimed. The common tactic of parasiting — adding a snippet of a distributed song to claim royalties on a longer video — is strictly prohibited.

---

## Artist Guidelines

- All content must be uploaded under an artist account which you control and represent.  
- SoundBloom will automatically flag all artists above an undisclosed popularity threshold and will need you to verify your affiliation.  
- Content might accidentally end up under another artist’s page when uploaded if they have the same name. Contact your account manager to fix this problem.  
- Required credit information, such as composer and lyricist, **must** be legal names. These names are sent to royalty collection agencies.

---

## Artificial Streams

- You are responsible for all penalties incurred from artificial streaming on your content.
- Any artificially streamed content will be removed from all platforms.  
- To prevent artificial streaming, do not pay for any service that promises you streams, playlist adds, or any illegitimate form of boosting.

---

## General Guidelines

- Ensure that all content does not contain pornography, or promote hatred based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other identities.  
- Do not use emojis in any metadata.  
- Do not include version information in the title — use the separate version field.  
  - For example, do not put `God’s Plan (Radio Edit)` as the title, only put `God’s Plan`.
