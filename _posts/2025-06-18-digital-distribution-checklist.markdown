This checklist ensures a smooth and effective digital music distribution process for artists and labels. Follow these steps to prepare, distribute, and promote your music across platforms.

## Pre-Release Preparation
- **Audio Files**
  - Export tracks in high-quality formats (WAV or FLAC, 16-bit/44.1kHz minimum).
  - Ensure files are properly named (e.g., `ArtistName - TrackTitle.wav`).
  - Check for audio issues (clipping, distortion, or silence).

  - Include accurate metadata (artist name, track title, album name, genre, release date).
  - Add ISRC codes for each track.
  - Embed lyrics (if applicable) and copyright information.
  - Specify explicit content if necessary.
- **Artwork**
  - Prepare album artwork (square, 3000x3000 pixels, JPG/PNG, RGB).
  - Ensure text is legible and complies with platform guidelines (e.g., no URLs or social media handles).
  - Verify artist and album names match metadata.
- **Rights and Licensing**
  - Confirm ownership or licensing for all tracks, samples, and covers.
  - Secure mechanical licenses for cover songs.
  - Register songs with a PRO (e.g., ASCAP, BMI) for royalty collection.
- **Distribution Account**

## Distribution Process

## Post-Release Promotion

- **Promote**
  - Share links to the release on social media, newsletters, and websites.
  - Submit to playlists (e.g., Spotify editorial, independent curators).
